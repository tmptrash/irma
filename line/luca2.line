# This code represents one digital organism. The meaning of
# it is to have LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor), which
# may clone himself, move, eat and dispose wastes. Code should 
# be as short as possible. Organism's code or body consists of
# molecules, which are separated by fake "sep" command. Size of 
# molecule is not limited. The purpose of organism is to find
# molecules in outside world, from which he consists of and
# build (clone) it's own body copy. First molecule [nop,nop]
# is a marker. The same marker should be at the end of main
# body to separate body and food section.
