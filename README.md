# irma (*beta) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tmptrash/irma.svg?branch=dots-as-commands)](https://travis-ci.com/tmptrash/irma)
Welcome to [Digital organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_organism) ecology simulation. This optimized engine has an ability to run up to 50 000 agents (organisms) and 5 000 000 molecules (matter or organism's food) in parallel within 2D virtual world. It uses linear assembler-like language [(LGP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_genetic_programming) as a [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA), which runs under self-made VM. The purpose of this project is to produce **complex behavior** of organisms based on generated code (DNA). Mentioned code is used as organism's "brain" and manages almost all his life aspects. Also, this system uses [evolution's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) like processes to change ([mutate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution#Mutation)) and select ([natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection)) best agents from population in the same way like nature does. This is how mentioned complex behavior should appear in theory. Through generations, every new organism should be more adoptive to virtual environment and more complex (but not always). Instead of neural networks, organisms use special byte code (mentioned "brain"), which run in infinite loop on special VM. Mutations affect this code to produce small variety in population. Best organisms will have more chances to produce children. This is, by the way, major criteria for such system. Mentioned mechanism is called [Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming), was developed by John Holland and John Koza. This engine uses [Linear Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_genetic_programming) technique. Also, main ideas obtained from [Synthesis theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)) and [Self-replicating machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine). 2D world consist of organisms and atoms - code instructions, which are food for constucting organisms bodies. Enjoy our research!

# Old research
#### Presentations
- [jevo 2016 (rus)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF77s_4RA08) - this presentation is about first attempts of obtaining complex behavior of organisms. Julia language was used for that. All details are presented in presentation.
- [construct 2017 (rus)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykr9KzcKq8) - this is next attempt to create complex behavior using distributed network of chrome browsers (NodeJs + browsers).
