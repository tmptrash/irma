# irma (*beta) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tmptrash/irma.svg?branch=dots-as-commands)](https://travis-ci.com/tmptrash/irma)
Welcome to [Artificial life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life) and [Digital organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_organism) ecology simulator. This optimized engine has an ability to run up to 50 000 agents (organisms) and 5 000 000 molecules (matter or organism's food) in parallel within 2D virtual world. It uses [(LGP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_genetic_programming) language as a [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA), which runs under self-made VM. The purpose of this project is to produce **complex behavior** of organisms based on generated byte code. Mentioned code is used as organism's "brain" and manages almost all his life aspects. Also, this system uses [evolution's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) like principles to change ([mutate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution#Mutation)) and select ([natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection)) best agents from population in the same way like nature does. We suppose that mentioned complex behavior may appear in such behavior. Through generations, every new organism should be more adoptive to virtual environment and maybe more complex (but not always). Instead of neural networks, organisms use special byte code (mentioned "brain"), which run in infinite loop on special VM. Mutations affect this code to produce small variety in population. Some organisms will have more chances to produce children. This is, by the way, major criteria of success for such system. This engine uses [Linear Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_genetic_programming) technique. Also, main ideas obtained from [Synthesis theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)) and [Self-replicating machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine). 2D world consist of organisms and atoms - code instructions, which are energy source and constuction blocks for organisms bodies.
Enjoy our research!

# Old research
#### Presentations
- [jevo 2016 (rus)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF77s_4RA08) - this presentation is about first attempts of obtaining complex behavior of organisms. Julia language was used for that. All details are presented in presentation.
- [construct 2017 (rus)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykr9KzcKq8) - this is next attempt to create complex behavior using distributed network of chrome browsers (NodeJs + browsers).
